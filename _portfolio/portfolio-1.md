As a supporter of research for sustainability, I had the distinct honor of participating in the Earth Week program at the University of Texas at Dallas. This event, a cornerstone of our commitment to environmental stewardship, culminated in the Earth Fair on April 20th, 2023. Among the highlights of this celebration was the Earth Week Poster Competition—a platform where students showcased their research in sustainability. It was here that my work, "Characterizing the Temporal Variation of Airborne Particulate Matter Using Variograms," was recognized as a finalist, underscoring the importance of innovative approaches in the quest for a sustainable environment.
Airborne particulate matter (PM), a byproduct of unsustainable practices such as fossil fuel combustion, transportation, and industrial emissions, poses significant risks to both environmental and public health. Addressing this challenge requires a nuanced understanding of PM distribution and its temporal variations across urban landscapes. My research employs variograms, a powerful geostatistical tool, to map these variations, offering insights into the frequency and distribution of PM concentration in neighborhoods.
Although Variograms are used in Geostatistics to understand the spatial variation. The same concept can be applied to determine the Temporal Variation of PM 
- Temporal Frequency Determination: Identifying the duration PM concentrates in specific locales is crucial. This step involves determining the optimal frequency of observation to capture meaningful temporal variations.
- Variogram Analysis for Observation Frequency: Through variogram analysis, we can define the necessary frequency of airborne particulate observations, ensuring the time series is adequately resolved and reflective of actual conditions.
- Understanding the Variogram: Also known as the semi-variogram, this function represents the average squared difference between points at varying distances. It is instrumental in analyzing temporal patterns of PM distribution.
- Key Characteristics of Variograms: The analysis focuses on three main aspects—range, sill, and nugget, with a particular emphasis on the 'Range.' This characteristic is pivotal as it delineates the temporal scale beyond which data points lack significant correlation, guiding the identification of observation intervals.
- Utilizing sliding windows to determine the range relative to each time step (1s intervals) throughout the day, my research introduces a novel approach to environmental monitoring. This methodology not only enhances the precision of measured time for PM level but also facilitates the development of more effective emission control strategies.

By advocating for more frequent and accurately targeted monitoring of PM levels, this research contributes to the foundational knowledge necessary for implementing sustainable practices. The ultimate goal is to mitigate the adverse effects of PM on the environment, paving the way for a cleaner, healthier future for succeeding generations.
Participating in UTD's Earth Week was not just an opportunity to present my research; it was a platform to contribute to the global dialogue on sustainability. Through the lens of geostatistics, we are one step closer to understanding and controlling the environmental impact of human activity, marking a significant stride towards our collective goal of sustainability.
