excerpt: 'The goal of this study is to describe a design architecture
for a self-powered sensor network that is currently being
deployed at various locations throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth
metroplex to measure and report on Particulate Matter (PM)
concentrations. This sensing system can collect data at remote
locations while remaining relatively inexpensive by combining
low-cost PM sensors with LoRaWAN connectivity. Because the
sensing system is GPS-enabled, the recorded values can also
be linked to the geographical coordinates of the sampling site.
Furthermore, the system is equipped with a small-scale, solar-
powered solution that enables it to operate without the need for
any type of grid connection and achieve energy self-sufficiency
without the need for any additional power.'
