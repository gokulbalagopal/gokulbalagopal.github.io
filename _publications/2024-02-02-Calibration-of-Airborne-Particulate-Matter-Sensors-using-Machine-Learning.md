excerpt: 'Currently, air pollution monitors that provide credible readings can cost approximately
5,000$. Research grade sensors may be several times more expensive. As a result,
there is a great need for sensors that are both cost efficient and capable of providing reliable
data. This has been aided by an increase in research over the last two decades aimed at
improving the quality of low-cost sensing via calibration.
We used machine learning to calibrate several kinds of sensors as part of the research
at MINTS lab. This was motivated by the concept of using machine learning to calibrate
sensors in orbiting satellites. This method may now be utilized on a large scale to calibrate
low-cost sensors installed across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.'
