title: "Characterizing the Temporal Variation of Airborne Particulate Matter using Variograms"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-02-03-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This study is based on the temporal variation of airborne particulate matter concentration
in a neighbourhood. Although the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) measures it on an hourly
basis, there is no definitive scientific agreement on the required frequency for these measurements.
Variogramâ€™s can determine the optimal frequency for measuring airborne particles to effectively
capture the time series. Variogram is commonly used in Geostatistics to measure the spatial correlation
or variability of mineral concentration in mines. A similar approach can be used to examine the
temporal variations of PM concentration in the atmosphere. Variations in the PM concentration at
successive time intervals are used to generate the new time scale. This study compares the time series
measurements of three distinctly polluted days for the month of January. The analysis shows a clear
difference between the measured time for these days.'
