## üíº Experience
### University of Texas at Dallas
***Research Assistant***

*January 2020 - Present, Dallas, TX*


- Established a Methodology for Quantifying the Sudden Variation in Particulate Matter (PM) Concentration.
- Currently there is no established methodology for quantifying the sudden variation in particulate matter (PM) concentration that transpired within the given hourly interval.
- The investigation is done in one of the most polluted areas of DFW, known as Joppa, and the frequency of measurements are calculated using a geostatistical method called variogram which is used for finding the location of gold nuggets in a mine. 
- Measurement time ranged from 1 to 2 minutes for the actively polluted areas indicating how frequently the monitor must be active. 
- An air parcel trajectory model called HYSPLIT was used to determine the course of polluted air, hence facilitating the identification of its origins. 
- Visualized the Polluted Air Parcels to identify Potential Particulate Matter (PM) sources across DFW metroplex.
- To provide affordable and high accuracy air quality monitoring systems for low-income neighborhoods in DFW.  
- Employed research-grade sensors, like Palas as reference and calibrated the cheaper monitors with them using machine learning. This doubled their accuracy and reduced the installation cost to less than one percent.
- Various regression models were used in our study and among them, neural network model yielded the greatest correlation coefficient of 0.99. A total of 17 measurements obtained from the  cheaper nodes were utilized as the independent variables, while 6 measurements of PM levels were used as the target variable. 
- Live Dashboards to visualize the time series data of the cheaper monitors were created using python‚Äôs plotly package. This helps in detecting outages, anomalies in sensor measurement and successfully handling them

*Supervisor: Professor David Lary*

### University of Houston
***Research Assistant***

*August 2017 - August 2018, Houston, TX*

- Ran Time Series models to predict variations in Particulate Matter (PM) concentration across Houston.

*Supervisor: Professor Peggy Lindner*
  
### QBurst
***Software Engineer***

*June 2015 - June 2016, Kerala, India*

- Developed an IoT platform as part of a team of 4 using AngularJS, enabling the connection of machines and sensors to the cloud for advanced monitoring and analytics.
- Implemented data extraction, analysis, visualization, and cloud integration to provide comprehensive insights from device-generated data.
- Contributed to a multi-million-dollar CMS application project for Uniqlo Co. Ltd., focusing on providing APIs for managing promo codes,   popular products, and email communication.
- Led the development of the user interface (UI) and REST-based APIs responsible for managing the distribution of promo code-related information via email.
- Played a crucial role in a CMS application project, estimated at approximately 1.5 million USD, aimed at creating platform-independent components for Uniqlo Co. Ltd websites, based on Google's material design principles.
- Utilized React-Redux scripting to design and generate components with attributes and aspects in alignment with Google's material-UI.
- Worked as a front-end developer using HTML, CSS, and ReactJS on a web application focused on analyzing social media data to gain insights into current trends and public sentiments related to various commercial brands.
- Utilized Facebook and Twitter APIs to provide analytical solutions for raw social media data, contributing to trend analysis and sentiment evaluation.
