## üíº Experience
### University of Texas at Dallas
***Research Assistant***

*January 2020 - Present, Dallas, TX*

- Developed a methodology for measuring rapid variations in particulate matter (PM) concentration within an hour, applied in Joppa,one of DFW's most polluted area, using geostatistical   variogram analysis for optimal measurement frequency.
- Achieved measurement intervals of 1-2 minutes in polluted areas, optimizing air quality monitor power usage.
- Utilized the HYSPLIT model for tracking polluted air parcels to identify pollution sources across DFW.
- Enhanced air quality monitoring in low-income neighborhoods by calibrating low-cost sensors with research-grade sensors using machine learning, significantly improving accuracy and reducing costs.
- Implemented stacking regression models with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 for precise PM level prediction, proving more efficient than deep neural networks.
- Created live dashboards with Plotly for real-time data visualization, enabling efficient anomaly detection and sensor management.
*Supervisor: Professor David Lary*

### University of Houston
***Research Assistant***

*August 2017 - August 2018, Houston, TX*

- Conducted neural network analysis on 17 years of Texas air pollution data to predict regional pollution levels based on environmental factors.
- Managed over 200 GB of data for comprehensive analysis.
- Automated Python and R script execution on the Opuntia Cluster using shell scripting for efficient data processing.

*Supervisor: Professor Peggy Lindner*
  
### QBurst
***Software Engineer***

*June 2015 - June 2016, Kerala, India*

- Developed an IoT platform as part of a team of 4 using AngularJS, enabling the connection of machines and sensors to the cloud for advanced monitoring and analytics.
- Implemented data extraction, analysis, visualization, and cloud integration to provide comprehensive insights from device-generated data.
- Contributed to a multi-million-dollar CMS application project for Uniqlo Co. Ltd., focusing on providing APIs for managing promo codes,   popular products, and email communication.
- Led the development of the user interface (UI) and REST-based APIs responsible for managing the distribution of promo code-related information via email.
- Played a crucial role in a CMS application project, estimated at approximately 1.5 million USD, aimed at creating platform-independent components for Uniqlo Co. Ltd websites, based on Google's material design principles.
- Utilized React-Redux scripting to design and generate components with attributes and aspects in alignment with Google's material-UI.
- Worked as a front-end developer using HTML, CSS, and ReactJS on a web application focused on analyzing social media data to gain insights into current trends and public sentiments related to various commercial brands.
- Utilized Facebook and Twitter APIs to provide analytical solutions for raw social media data, contributing to trend analysis and sentiment evaluation.
