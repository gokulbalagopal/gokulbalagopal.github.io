I am a driven PhD researcher and engineer with a profound expertise in electrical engineering, machine learning, and statistical analysis. My academic endeavors at the University of Texas at Dallas and the University of Houston have fortified my knowledge in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical methods, achieving a GPA of 3.53/4.00 and 3.70/4.00 during my PhD and Masterâ€™s respectively.

My professional experience is marked by pioneering projects in environmental monitoring, notably in the characterization of airborne particulate matter and calibration of particulate sensors utilizing advanced machine learning techniques. These projects have significantly improved the accuracy of environmental monitoring tools, making air quality data more accessible, especially in underprivileged regions.

I have adeptly applied optimization techniques to fit empirical models to theoretical fits, enhancing the precision and reliability of characterizing the time scale for measuring the Particulate Matter Concentration. Currently, I have developed a temporal variogram functionality that encapsulates these concepts, aiming to revolutionize the way temporal and spatial data are analyzed and interpreted. My proficiency spans across various programming languages and libraries, including Julia, Python, R, along with machine learning libraries like MLJ, pandas, numpy, and keras.

With publications pending in prestigious journals like MDPI and IEEE, my work exemplifies a commitment to advancing environmental monitoring and the application of machine learning. My diverse skill set, encompassing project leadership, technical innovation, and practical application of machine learning and statistical analysis to solve real-world problems, positions me as a forward-thinking researcher and engineer.
